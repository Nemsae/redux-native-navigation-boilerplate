// The layouts directory doesn’t directly align with any single goal but the purpose
// here is to give us an idea of different experiences a user may expect in our
// app — it’s mostly for developer happiness and ease of understanding.
// For example an app may have an Auth layout, an Admin layout, and a general App
// layout. The directories themselves are organized very similarly to the app/components/ directory.
//
// In a layout I’ll normally setup the global navigation for that layout (like tabs or a menu).
